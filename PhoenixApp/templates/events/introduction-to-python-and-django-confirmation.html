Django is a backend development course that has been planned to be conducted to complement the ongoing frontend development course, to help our attendees get a grip on full-stack development as a whole. The course is beginner friendly, and there are no pre-requisites for undertaking it. Mr. Gupta is a 2019 pass-out from the IT branch of our college, and is currently employed as a full stack developer at Givemefive.ai. So why think twice before grabbing an opportunity to learn from someone from within the industry?
